# [magic-spells](https://github.com/Billy-Budd/magic-spells/)
The super-repository for all of the parts and the final product of Compiler Design.
Please note that the README.md in the folders [flexicution](/flexicution) and [hip-to-be-square](/hip-to-be-square) are deprecated and the links are now broken that this is a super-repository including all versions of this project. Name here is a reference to [Crystal Castles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Castles)' song [Magic Spells](https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-magic-spells-lyrics) which can be heard [here](https://youtu.be/fUTJa00puDU). Definitely one of my favorite electronic albums of all time, but programming and compilation are by no means 'magic.' 

## [flexicution](/flexicution)
Project part 1A where we modify the earlier code (in this case, [hip-to-be-square](/hip-to-be-square)) to use flex to find tokens. The temporary name this had was [FlexicalAnalysis](/flexicution/FlexicaAnalysis.l) since the first part of the project was [LexicalAnalysis](/hip-to-be-square/LexicalAnalysis.cpp) and it felt very fitting. The only song that I knew had 'flex' in the tile is [Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_(rapper))'s [Flexicution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexicution) which you can listen to [here](https://youtu.be/M2NIMHVmGwk). 
Program contains a menu that details its uses (but not the language that it compiles, please see [instructions](/flexicution/proj1a-instructions.docx) or [input.txt](/flexicution/input.txt)). It does not accept a parameter via the command line but I plan to add that in the next iteration of the project. 

- [sample-input](/flexicution/1a-sample-input.docx): this is the raw sample input given from professor. This can be accessed directly in the program by executing the program, and pressing enter to use the base case text. 
- [response-doc](/flexicution/CS4386.501p01a_JML190001.pdf): this is a response doc answering some of the questions in the outline given by the professor.
- [FlexicalAnalysis.l](/flexicution/FlexicaAnalysis.l): I misnamed the file name and I am not keen on changing it now, but this is the source code of mixed lex and c/c++ code. 
- [README.md](/flexicution/README.md): deprecated. Please disregard.
- [input.txt](/flexicution/input.txt): this is [sample-input](/flexicution/1a-sample-input.docx) in file format that is easy to use for c/c++.
- [lex.yy.c](/flexicution/lex.yy.c): this is the compiled lex code (non-compiled c).
- [instructions](/flexicution/proj1a-instructions.docx): instructions given by professor.

## [hip-to-be-square](/hip-to-be-square)
[Hip to be Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_to_Be_Square) is a [song](https://youtu.be/LB5YkmjalDg) by [Huey Lewis and the News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_Lewis_and_the_News) and I had absolutely no reason to name it this as I cannot think of any connection that it has to the song. The only connection is that a compiler (that is being designed in this class) is taking code and making it 'square' by compiling it, but that is such a stretch that you might as well completely disregard this. 

- [sample-input](/hip-to-be-square/input.txt): sample input
- [source](/hip-to-be-square/LexicalAnalysis.cpp): source code
- [executable](/hip-to-be-square/LexicalAnalysis.exe): if you are using an input file, make sure the file is in the same folder as the executable
- [requirements](/hip-to-be-square/assign1(1).docx): requirements for assignment
- [response](/hip-to-be-square/CS4386.501a01_JML190001.pdf): response to questions at the bottom of the requirements document
